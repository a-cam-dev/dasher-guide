## Section 1: tl;dr
Here is the short version of the guide that includes the most important tips and strategies :3

1. Take it easy
	- The controlling variable for how much money you make is how much time you spend dashing, not how fast you go. No matter how much you speed and sprint, you're going to be running into a hard limit of about $25/hr under normal conditions. Take your time and chill out :3
2. Stick to the same area
	- Since the total time you spend dashing is the biggest factor in how much money you make , your priority is to maximize that. Therefore, minimizing the amount of energy you use is key to dashing longer.
	- The biggest energy drain while doordashing is how much cognitive processing you're having to do.
		- High mental drain activities:
			- Driving in traffic/rush hour
			- Driving in a new area
			- Navigating unfamiliar apartment complexes
	- Focusing on one area to dash allows you to become familiar with the roads, traffic patterns, apartments, parking, and restaurants
3. Build up your stamina
	- Start off in 3 hour stints. Doing more when you're first starting will lead to burnout. Get comfortable with this length and then build up
4. Times & Demand Reference (based on Davis)
	- 5pm - rush hour, the worst
	- 6-8pm - less traffic but downtown is still busy, parking is hard
	- 9pm - this is when a lot of casual dashers do an hour or two so it can be hard to find good orders
	- 10pm-2am - consistent demand, no traffic, my preferred time
	- 3am-4:30am - this is the time frame where you'll have to start waiting for orders and is a good time to end
5. Strategy on what orders to accept
	- a general rule is $2/mile on the order
		- the miles listed will be the distance from your current location to the drop off
		- this is a good reference but isn't always the best to follow
			- sometimes there just aren't going to be any good paying orders and in this case it's better to be completing orders than waiting
				- you'll be reimbursed at the end of the week if you're below the average amount of money made per hour that week  by all dashers in your area
	- Keep your acceptance rate above 70%
		- This will gain you higher order priority and will get you top dasher status at the end of the month
		- Tbh a lot of the time you should just accept every order they give you, but if you do this too much they'll start giving you all the shitty orders so you need to decline the rly bad ones
6. Get Top Dasher status by the end of your first month
	- this is your highest priority as it has the largest impact on how much money you'll make in the long term
	- Conditions to meet for Top Dasher status:
		- 100 deliveries in the month
		- 70%+ acceptance rate
		- High rating
			- idk the actual rating but it's p easy to get
	- It resets at 12am on the 1st of each month

I'll make an intermediate guide soon :3
